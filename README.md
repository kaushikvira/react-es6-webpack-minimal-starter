# react-es6-webpack-minimal-starter

A minimal React/ES6/Webpack starter template using Webpack &amp; Babel.
The code is from the facebook [Getting Started](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html)
page.

## To Use

```
npm install webpack -g
npm install
webpack
```

Then navigate using a browser to `build/index.html`.

The entry point `build/index.html` (which contains a `<script>` element
to load `bundle.js`) is currently hand-built and not yet automated.
